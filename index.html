<p>The Syndeysider said the federal government’s ban is “absolutely pointless”.</p>

<p>Whilst she’s not one of the researchers initially quoted in the article, I’m not convinced she’s not biased in her assessment of good or bad in this case.</p>

			 <p>We used to have Stars, Celebrities, and Personalities, in various fields, be it movies, tv, music, sports, etc. Nowadays, according to most media outlets, everyone seemingly is called a Star.</p>
<p>My question would be, if everyone is a star, is anyone actually a star?</p>

			 <p>Looks to be pretty busy, but shouldn’t be too stressful if things go to plan. 🤞</p>
<p><strong>Monday</strong> - finish clearing the garage and make a couple of tip runs</p>
<p><strong>Tuesday</strong> - setup golf sim in the garage, football meeting at 5pm, sports club board meeting at 6pm</p>
<p><strong>Wednesday</strong> - take the boat out on Lake Macquarie, try to catch some fish and crabs for Sunday BBQ</p>
<p><strong>Thursday</strong> - same as Wednesday</p>
<p><strong>Friday</strong> - same as Wednesday, if I haven’t caught enough for the Sunday BBQ, otherwise play some golf</p>
<p><strong>Saturday</strong> - no plans</p>
<p><strong>Sunday</strong> - early trial match between between my sons team and Singleton Under 18’s, then family Christmas BBQ</p>
<p>Plenty on, nothing stressful, let’s go!</p>

<p>Thursday’s inquiry into the new laws ran for just three hours, with Australians given only a day to lodge submissions.</p>

<p>The government has said it will rely on some form of age-verification technology to implement the restrictions but the details are vague and the technology has not been finalised.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The onus will be on social media companies to add age-verification tools themselves.</p>

<p>The ban involves the highest age limit set by any country, and does not include exemptions for those with parental consent.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There will be no penalties for parents or children who ignore the rules.</p>

<p>I don’t understand why we are rushing this through?
What is being hidden in the legislation?
How will the age verification work?
How can you determine that I am over the age of 16?
Does this become a way to have a national ID system?</p>
